Summary: This is the about page for my blog.

 It’s no surprise that the amount of information at our disposal brings a large amount of group-think, what others think is important, valuable, and on how to attain it. Because of this, it’s becoming increasingly important to have a continued strong commitment to self-reflection. In order to have a meaningful life, you need to decide for yourself what is valuable and meaningful for you.  

I don't have all the answers because no one really does. Part of this blog is just trying to figure things out, it’s a journey to try discover these metaphorical truths.  

I’m an aspiring data scientist/engineer. I enjoy deep-diving into various computer topics, reinforcement learning, AI games, and systems architecture and various non-computer topics, psychology, philosophy, self-improvement.  

All the best,
