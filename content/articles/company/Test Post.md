Summary: Sourdough pizza is easy to make and is insanely delicious.

# Header 1  
So I just started a sourdough starter and it is pretty amazing. Who knew a bunch of flour and water. when given enough time, could yield such delicious bread and pizza. Sure, it takes some consistent effort to feed the starter daily, but your effort will certainly not be in vain - sourdough is both delicious and low gi. That means it causes your blood sugar to spike less than regular bread.

Food | Sourdough | Delicious
--- | --- | ---
pizza | yes | extremely
pizza | no | still delicious
bread | yes | yum!
bread | no | ehh, it's alrite

My favourite quote, the man in the arena by Theodore Rosevelt: 
> It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs; who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
Be the man in the arena and not the critic.
